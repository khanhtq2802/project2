# project2
This is my work in Project-2 course in SOICT, HUST

The goal of the project is to create a tool to label images

This application is only available on Windows.

Some features:
- Move images
- Edit images (include in Move image)
- Draw bounding box (developing)

To use the tool, all you need is Project-2\bin\Debug folder, then run Project-2.exe.
